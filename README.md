First started messing with coding in 2000 when I got a MtG box set that came with a tutorial CD. Tried so very very hard to add in more than just the default cards and ended up breaking the game. Finally figured out enough of what i was doing to create basic chat bots with auto responses. Created my first game in 2004 using a TI-82 plus, decoded another game and redid everything into a new game to understand how the language worked, ended up making a basic tank battle game, based off Tanks as well(unfortunatly I'm not that good on figuring out the graphics side). As well as a text based racing game. Weird I know, was basically an idle racing game in 2005 before the genre existed, because all you did was spend the winnings and pick the race. Either your stats were good enough to win, or you had to buy more pieces. Spent time playing around with Game Maker Studios, but never was able to finish a project, mostly because I can't do the grapic stuff I want to include, and my stick figure temp images are downright pitiful. So motivation usually dwindles when I reach a point where something graphical is required. I hate it, but I deal with it by finding projects like halite that only require coding. Which I did participate in Halite 2, just got stuck on being unable to figure out a specific line of code to do something I don't remember. So didn't get that far, as most of what I know is sporadic bits from here and there. Self taught, mostly tearing apart code to understand how the language works. I learn more by doing, than I do by having someone talk at me.
The first game I ever found, that made me want to understand how to make them, was just a bot in a chat room, that basically let you play an rpg in chat. That was the most facinating thing to me. Probably because it was something made by an idividual and not a company. But regardless, I spent many hours in a chat room talking to a bot because of it.
So whenever my hyper focus circles back around to it, I dive back into coding, and try to find projects that I can tackle and work on before my interest begins to wane. But I've enjoyed Ruby, and I know Python is better, but the symantics are an important thing to me and I think Ruby has the prettier finished product. I've spent some time in C# and only more than none in JS. Haven't really stepped outside of that zone, but due to the nature of my passion for coding, I tend to have a need to relearn aspects. And as such it makes things more irritating, because I can remember having done them before.
But regardless of all that block of text, I enjoy typing and seeing it make the screen dance.


I’m currently working on a Mod for the game Warzone 2100, one of my og favorites. Since the game has been open source since '05, I've enjoyed others efforts and thought to bring in my own. Though the community has waned in the past few.

I’m currently learning ...
I’m looking to collaborate on ...

I’m looking for help with my current project, as I'm having issues with triggering video files, and I currently believe it to be a limitation on the coding of the game engine side, but have no idea how to fix it.

Ask me about anything, we're all strangers here, and I have no problem telling anyone anything if I'll never see their face.

How to reach me: The worst thing, but leave a message here I'll see it if I'm active, otherwise...

Pronouns: As the saying goes, I don't care what you call me, as long as you don't call me late for dinner.

Fun fact: I'm more open and fun online, than in person.
